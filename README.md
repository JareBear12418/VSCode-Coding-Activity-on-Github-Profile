# VSCode-Coding-Activity-on-Github-Profile

Have an activity graph on your GitHub profile showcasing your activity in visual studio code. 


# Setup

- Setting this up is a bit tricky. So please follow the instructions clearly. 
1. *IMPORTANT*!!!! Install the [Local Time Tracker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=FabricioRojas.localtimetracker) created by [Fabricio Rojas](https://github.com/FabricioRojas). 
2. Clone your profile repository.
    - E.x: `git clone https://github.com/JareBear12418/JareBear12418/`
    - Your username twice basicly.
3. *Copy* the [main.py](https://github.com/JareBear12418/VSCode-Coding-Activity-on-Github-Profile/blob/master/main.py) into your cloned repository on your system.
4.  Create a `.gitignore` file in your repository. 
    - Add `main.py` and `.gitignore`.

So far your directory should look like the following:
